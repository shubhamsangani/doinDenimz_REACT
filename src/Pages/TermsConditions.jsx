          <p className="mt-4">
            We are responsible only to provide the measurements you send us. If
            jeans do not fit on your body with your provided measurements, you
            cannot claim any dispute. We keep all photographs of different parts
            on the jeans and ensure with the provided measurements that
            everything is in order.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Some measurements cannot be adjusted as you provide, i.e Back Rise
            &amp; Thighs on 6". Back rise is related to front rise measurement
            and it can be in some fix amount more then front rise. We have right
            to change the back rise according to front rise you mention.
            generally back rise would be 3.50"-4.50" larger then front rise.
            Thighs on 6" is related to Thighs on 1" and Knee measurements and we
            have right to change thighs on 6" according to thighs on 1" and
            knee.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            When you wear our jeans for the first time you feel the waist, seat
            &amp; thighs slight tighter than your original measurement you gave
            us. We say by our wide experience, it will become loose after
            wearing 2 - 3 hours. So, don't worry about it.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            As these custom made jeans are stitched first &amp; then put on wash
            treatments, so measurements may differ a bit. But 0.50"-0.75"
            difference is acceptable in the specialized custom clothing
            industry. Also keep in mind that these jeasn are hand made so some
            jeans may look different from readymade jeans.
